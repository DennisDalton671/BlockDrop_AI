# Tetris AI Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Tetris AI using heuristic and machine learning techniques. The AI plays Tetris, making decisions based on the current state of the game board, 
with the goal of maximizing the score by clearing lines, optimizing block placement, and minimizing gaps. 

Here's a look at the homescreen of Tetris AI:

### Features

- Heuristic AI for Tetris game logic.

- Machine learning model to enhance decision-making.

- Pathfinding algorithm for optimal block placement.

- Analysis of different strategies for playing Tetris.

### Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) (Version 15 or later recommended)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (For Kotlin-based projects)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (For project dependency management)

## Installation

Installation and Setup with Android Studio

1. Clone the repository:

- Open Android Studio and select "Get from Version Control."
  In the URL field, enter https://github.com/DennisDalton671/Tetris_AI and click "Clone."

2. Open the project:

- If not automatically opened, select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the cloned project directory (Tetris_AI).

3, Run the project:

- After the project has synced and the Gradle build is finished, select "Run" > "Run 'app'" to start the application on an emulator or connected Android device.

## Usage

- The Tetris AI app can be run directly from Android Studio by pressing the "Run" button. Make sure you have an Android emulator set up or a device connected to test the application.
